# Portfolio

## Description
This is my portfolio. It outlines and goes through all my skills, projects and socials. I was motivated to build this project because I wanted to have my own portfolio that other Githubbers and employers could see. I am studying within the University of Sydney to achieve a certificate of Full Stack Development. To understand further, plese take a look at my portfolio using the link below.
